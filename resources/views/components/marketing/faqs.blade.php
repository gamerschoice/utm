                <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Absolutely! You can switch to higher usage plans from your billing dashboard. Or, alternatively, you can add extra resources such as domains and seats to your account on-the-fly as an extra monthly subscription. Extra domains are priced at £5/m, and additional seats are priced at £2/m. These are billed monthly, regardless of the billing cycle on your plan.</p>
